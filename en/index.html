Essential information to live freely in a decentralized society, version 1</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>

</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Starting point: human rights</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The United Nations’
	Universal Declaration of Human Rights is outdated and disputed  
	(see <a href="https://www.lacan.com/zizek-human.htm">Žižek's dissertation on the topic</a>), but its 30
	articles constitute a good starting point to define the rights that
	every human should enjoy.</p>
	</li>

	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    What we mean by decentralization</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	We take decentralization to mean not the delegation of government from a central one to smaller subordinate governments, 
but the transformation of services and institutions to a form where there is no central controlling entity; rather control 
emerges from the collective will of the people, like a colony of ants shows intelligent behavior without there being a 
central authority, only a simple set of rules shared by every member of society. </p>
	</li>

	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">What we would
	like to change</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Most of us
	currently live in centralized nation states, pay taxes on their
	earnings, vote in elections at various levels, use a national or
	supranational currency, use their national ID to prove their
	identity, and deal with slow and inconvenient institutions and their
	bureaucracy every day. The advances made in the past 30 years
	(namely: the Internet, widespread use of powerful personal
	computers, and cryptocurrencies) represent powerful tools for the gradual
	emancipation of the people from the increasingly superfluous nation states we
	live in. Decentralized systems are preferable wherever they are possible, 
    as they are largely immune to many of the flaws of centralized institutions 
    (corruption, waste, delays, high cost, bureaucracy, censorship...). 
    This concept has been explored by many academics; here an excerpt from 
    Leopold Kohr's <i>The Breakdown of Nations</i>:</p>
    <p class="quote" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    "...why should not as many individuals have as many different institutions as they 
    like instead of having all to use a single costume which half of them might consider 
    not to their taste? If freedom of choice is considered an advantage economically, why 
    not also politically? For, with a great multitude of systems prevailing in an area 
    inhabited by hundreds of millions of people, it becomes mathematically inevitable 
    that far more individuals are able to obtain what their hearts desire than if the 
    same region were to permit only a single system, even as in a restaurant many more 
    people can obtain satisfaction if the menu includes a great variety of dishes rather 
    than a single one which can be made palatable to all only through the propaganda of the cook."
    </p>

    New technologies</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In order to mold
	this new decentralized stateless society, we must all familiarize
	ourselves with the technologies that will support it. This means
	you, the reader, have a personal responsibility to collect
	information on, understand and discuss these technologies. You can
	start by <a href="https://ddg.co">searching the internet</a> or talking to people you
	deem knowledgeable on new technologies. These are some topics you
	can research: decentralization, cryptography, cryptocurrency,
	blockchain, <a href="https://fsf.org">Free software</a>, non-fungible token, decentralized finance, <a href="https://torproject.org">the onion router</a>, <a href="http://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>.</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Identity
    </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	Your identity is currently verified by your state. Without a state, how
	will you prove your identity? New digital identity systems will
	emerge. However, you must not trust your state to handle the
	identification process. How can you tell whether a digital
	identification system is trustworthy? Decentralized ID systems will
	also emerge: your identity will live on a blockchain and be verified 
    not only by the network, but also by people in your social group who can 
    vouch for the accordance of the information to your real person.</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Laws
    </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	States control the laws that govern our lives. Without a centralized state
	and its political system, who will write and approve our laws? Fair,
	decentralized systems need to be engineered to handle legislature:
	the people of a certain state or region might, for example, decide
	to digitalize their laws and implement a system that allows
	everybody to use their digital decentralized identity to vote on
	proposals that other citizens have made; and allow anybody that
	meets certain requirements to make proposals within a certain limit.
	Workers and consumers of a certain industry might decide to
	implement a similar system to handle its regulation.</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Private finance
    </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    A multitude of decentralized currencies have emerged in the past years.
    States are now also developing digital currencies, centralized ones.
    You must not trust these, as they only reinforce the states’ authority 
    and allow an unacceptable amount of surveillance. You should only use
	decentralized currencies, and prefer ones that don’t require a lot
	of energy to be created.</p>
	</li>

	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Taxation and public finance
    </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Once society is completely detached from the state, taxation will change radically, 
    as no central body remains to demand it. To reach this point, communities will have to arrange systems to provide funds to 
    bodies now heavily dependent on taxes, such as education, 
    social security, health, and defense, so that they can continue to serve 
    society independently of centralized national governments. For instance, a local community 
    could decide to institute a common fund, persistent or temporary, for a more or less specific 
    purpose, and have all participants contribute a small amount, once or periodically. If said 
    fund is generic in purpose, money will be allocated to projects according to the people's 
    proposals. Systems like these must be engineered with transparency and integrity always in mind, and they must be reviewed by a large number of engineers. 
    None of these diverse solutions for public funding schemes developed by communities will be 
    perfect, but they will gradually evolve as we observe the effects, share solutions and learn from each other. </p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Environment, waste and energy</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    The global climate has been altered by human activity. We must all 
    be conscious that the environment needs protection, and can be changed 
    for the better. Arid regions need reforestation, we must reduce our use 
    of oil, plastic, beef and pork and substitute them for clean or nuclear
	energy, recyclable or biodegradable materials, and other sources of
	proteins: plants, chicken, eggs, artificial meat, and insects.</p>
	</li>
    <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
    Transition
    </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
	The transition to this stateless society begins here and now, with you.
	Start thinking about how our current institutions can be replaced by
	decentralized systems that are safe and fair. As local communities develop and adopt successful systems, 
    communities elsewhere will start to emulate them, and contribute to the improvement of said systems.
