            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The United Nations’
                Universal Declaration of Human Rights is outdated and disputed
                (see <a href="https://www.lacan.com/zizek-human.htm">Žižek's dissertation on the topic</a>), but its 30
                articles constitute a good starting point to define the rights that
                every human should enjoy. This text is meant to be useful to everybody, given that the changes described are happening on a global scale. It will, auspicably, be particularly useful to the communities of those places that lack services and institutions entirely, or where the latter deny the people their human rights and individual freedoms. The changes described below have the objective of minimizing the suffering of oppressed peoples and allowing their societies to progress. </p>

                What we mean by decentralization</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
                We take decentralization to mean not the delegation of government from a central one to smaller subordinate governments,
                but the transformation of services and institutions to a form where there is no central controlling entity; rather control
                emerges from the collective will of the people, like a colony of ants shows intelligent behavior without there being a
                central authority, only a simple set of rules shared by every member of society. </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">What we would
                like to change</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Most of us
                currently live in centralized nation states, pay taxes on their
                earnings, vote in elections at various levels, use a national or
                supranational currency, use their national ID to prove their
                identity, and deal with slow and inconvenient institutions and their
                bureaucracy every day. The advances made in the past 30 years
                (namely: the Internet, widespread use of powerful personal
                computers, and cryptocurrencies) represent powerful tools for the gradual
                emancipation of the people from the increasingly superfluous nation states we
                live in. Decentralized systems are preferable wherever they are possible,
                as they are largely immune to many of the flaws of centralized institutions
                (corruption, waste, delays, high cost, bureaucracy, censorship, periodic unusability...). The integrity of such systems would be verifiable by any end user, eliminating all doubt.
                Decentralization has been discussed and proposed in various forms since decades; here an excerpt from
                Leopold Kohr's <i>The Breakdown of Nations</i>:</p>
            <p class="quote" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
                "...why should not as many individuals have as many different institutions as they
                like instead of having all to use a single costume which half of them might consider
                not to their taste? If freedom of choice is considered an advantage economically, why
                not also politically? For, with a great multitude of systems prevailing in an area
                inhabited by hundreds of millions of people, it becomes mathematically inevitable
                that far more individuals are able to obtain what their hearts desire than if the
                same region were to permit only a single system, even as in a restaurant many more
                people can obtain satisfaction if the menu includes a great variety of dishes rather
                than a single one which can be made palatable to all only through the propaganda of the cook."

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In order to mold
                this new society free of central national governments, we must all familiarize
                ourselves with the technologies that will support it. This means
                you, the reader, have a personal responsibility to collect
                information on, understand and discuss these technologies. You can
                start by <a href="https://ddg.co">searching the internet</a> or talking to people you
                deem knowledgeable on new technologies. These are some topics you

                Your identity is currently verified by your state. Without a state, how

                identification process. How can you tell whether a digital
                identification system is trustworthy? Decentralized ID systems will
                also emerge: your identity will live on a blockchain and be verified
                not only by the network, but also by people in your social group who can
                vouch for the accordance of the information to your real person.</p>

                States control the laws that govern our lives. Without a centralized state
                and its political system, who will write and approve our laws? Fair,
                decentralized systems need to be engineered to handle legislature:
                the people of a certain state or region might, for example, decide
                to digitalize their laws and implement a system that allows
                everybody to use their digital decentralized identity to vote on
                proposals that other citizens have made; and allow anybody that
                meets certain requirements to make proposals within a certain limit.
                Workers and consumers of a certain industry might decide to
                implement a similar system to handle its regulation. A community might also choose to complement its judicial system with a lottocracy, a trustless system that selects a random sample of people who are then asked to make a judgement collectively. </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
                A multitude of decentralized currencies have emerged in the past years.
                States are now also developing digital currencies, centralized ones.
                You must not trust these, as they only reinforce the states’ authority
                and allow an unacceptable amount of surveillance. You should only use
                decentralized currencies, and prefer ones that don’t require a lot
                of energy to be created. There already exist networks that provide financial
                services (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange">exchange</a>, 
                lending, borrowing, <a href="https://joincircles.net">universal basic income</a>) 
                in a decentralized manner (see <a href="https://compound.finance">compound.finance</a> for an example of a lending/borrowing scheme).</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
                As society detaches from the state, taxation will change radically,
                as the central body that demands it is withering away. To advance towards the goal, communities will have to arrange systems to provide funds to
                bodies now heavily dependent on taxes, such as education,
                social security, health, and defense, or make them self-sufficient, so that they can continue to serve
                society independently of centralized national governments. For instance, a local community
                could decide to institute a common fund, persistent or temporary, for a more or less specific
                purpose, and periodically pay into it a small portion of the revenue of collective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">contracts</a>. If said
                fund is generic in purpose, money will be allocated to projects according to the people's
                proposals. Systems like these must be engineered with transparency and integrity always in mind, and they must be reviewed by a large number of engineers.
                None of these diverse solutions for public funding schemes developed by communities will be
                perfect, but they will gradually evolve as we observe the effects, share solutions and learn from each other. </p>

                decentralized systems that are safe and fair; if you're an engineer, start building. As local communities develop and adopt successful systems,
